Ways Of Writing CSS
1. Inline CSS
2. Internal CSS
3. External CSS

1. Inline CSS: Inline CSS is used to apply CSS to a single HTML element. It is defined within the style attribute of an HTML tag. It is used to apply a unique style to a single element.
2. Internal CSS: Internal CSS is used to apply CSS to a single HTML document. It is defined within the head tag of an HTML document. It is used to apply a unique style to a single document.

Selectors in CSS
1. Element Selector
2. ID Selector
3. Class Selector
4. Attribute Selector
5. Pseudo-class Selector
6. Pseudo-element Selector

1. Element Selector: Element Selector is used to select all the elements of a particular type. For example, to select all the paragraphs in an HTML document, we can use the p selector.
2. ID Selector: ID Selector is used to select an element with a specific ID. For example, to select an element with the ID of "myElement", we can use the #myElement selector.
3. Class Selector: Class Selector is used to select all the elements with a specific class. For example, to select all the elements with the class of "myClass", we can use the .myClass selector.
4. Attribute Selector: Attribute Selector is used to select elements based on their attributes. For example, to select all the elements with the attribute of "type" equal to "text", we can use the [type="text"] selector.
5. Pseudo-class Selector: Pseudo-class Selector is used to select elements based on their state. For example, to select all the links that are in the "hover" state, we can use the :hover selector.
6. Pseudo-element Selector: Pseudo-element Selector is used to select a specific part of an element. For example, to select the first line of a paragraph, we can use the ::first-line selector.

Selector Hierarchy: CSS selectors can be combined to create more specific and powerful selectors. For example, we can use the descendant selector to select all the elements inside a specific element. For example, to select all the paragraphs inside a div element, we can use the div p selector.

which one is the highest?
The highest specificity is determined by the number of id selectors, class selectors, attribute selectors, pseudo-class selectors, and pseudo-element selectors in the selector. The more selectors there are, the higher the specificity. For example, the selector #myId.myClass[type="text"]:hover::first-line has a higher specificity than the selector .myClass[type="text"]:hover::first-line.
